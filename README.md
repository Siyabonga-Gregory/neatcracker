👉Please, before you release any paid software to the public , make sure you have fully tested the software for trials versions because it very very sad to see powerfully software's relying on a computer's current time for trial countdown.

👉I have develop a simply bat file to lock the computer time within the countdown duration , This make some trial software in thinking there that it still in a count down range where's not.

👉You can use this trick if the other program's on your computer doesn't depend on your local timer for consistency but else don't use this trick, rather just buy a software license..

👉This trick doesn't crack the software or installing any type of some sort of cracking, NO , it doesn't do that , All it does is locking the count down timer in a range so to make the software think in still in a count down range..

👉Please, if you do afford to buy the license key, then do purchase it or else try this trick...

👉To us software developer's and tester's, Please, let us try to implement a different way to handle our trials software's for count down timer rather that replying on a local computer's timer.

👉I'm not a hacker , cracker , script kiddie, not I'm not all that.....I'm just a student , learning everyday.

All the best !

# How to use this bat file ? 
Start the trial software then before the trial countdown expired , run the bat file as administrator

Please, note your computer time won't be accurate 😂 meaning you have to update your computer time as soon you're done using the trial software and make sure you have close the bat file.
